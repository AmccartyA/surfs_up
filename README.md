Analyzing weather data with jupyter notebook and turning it into an app for use with our Surf Shop
## Overview of Analysis
This app shows temperature statistics for June and December. We got the temperature data by running two seperate queries that found the temperature for each day of the month over several years. We stored the queries in a dataframe and used that to get a summary.
 
## Results
In June the Average Temperature is 74, with the lowest being around 64 and Highest at about 85. That means we should try to stay open every day as long as temperatures are above 70 degrees.
 
In December are average is still good at 71 degrees, but with a Minimum temperature being as low as 56 Degrees. We can probably choose to be closed on certain days so we aren't sitting around with no customers.
## Conclusion
While the information is minimal, we can use this app further to study rain for certain months and possible tide patterns!
